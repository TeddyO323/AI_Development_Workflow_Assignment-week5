# AI Development Workflow – Assignment Project

This repository contains the full submission for the **AI Development Workflow Assignment** under the *AI for Software Engineering* course. The project follows the complete end-to-end lifecycle of an AI system — from problem definition to deployment and monitoring — using a healthcare readmission prediction case study.

The work is organized into clearly structured parts to make navigation easy for reviewers, instructors, and collaborators.
